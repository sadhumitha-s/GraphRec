--- Version Control ---

.git
.gitignore

--- C++ Build Artifacts (Local) ---

cpp_engine/build/
**/CMakeCache.txt
**/CMakeFiles

--- Compiled Binaries (Local) ---

Ignore local Mac/Windows binaries so they don't break Linux

*.so
*.dylib
*.dll
.pyd
backend/.so

--- Python Junk ---

**/pycache
**/.pyc
**/.pyo
**/venv
**/env
**/.venv

--- Local Databases ---

We ignore these so the container starts fresh OR uses the volume map

*.db
*.sqlite3
backend/graphrec.db

--- Secrets ---

We exclude .env from the image build (it is injected by compose instead)

.env
.env.local
backend/.env

--- IDE & OS Junk ---

.vscode
.idea
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
